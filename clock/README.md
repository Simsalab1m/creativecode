# Hypno Clock

This is a clock that I made in P5JS. I used some of the same code that I used in the 16 circle challenge that we did in class. You tell the time of the clock by counting the amount of rings in each circle. The big one to the left is the seconds, the big one to the right is minutes and the smaller one in the middle is hours.

I think that it is hypnotic in a way if you just stare at it as more and more circles appear. It might not be the best at actually telling time but it can help you get a rough idea by seeing how many circles there are.
