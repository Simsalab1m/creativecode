# Bot Project

This bot, [@ImgurHaikus](https://twitter.com/ImgurHaikus), generates haikus and randomly pulls imgur images. You get to decide if there is any correlation between them.
This bot has a very high number of possible outcomes. Just to create the imgur link there are 916132832 (62 * 62 * 62 * 62 * 62)
	"alphanumeric":["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z","A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","0"],

For the Haikus I have lists of words up to 6 syllables, with lists 1, 2 and 3 having 1000 words, list 4 having 803,  5 having 196 and 6 having 19, with 11 possible haiku syllable patterns.

The bot is hosted at [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com), so the code is a [Tracery](http://www.tracery.io/) grammar.
