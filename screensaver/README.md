# Logo Bounce

This screensaver came to be from me messing around in the P5JS editor. I watched a tutorial for how to make a bouncing ball, then learned that you can make the background transparent and see all of the sketches of the ball. After that I just messed around with it and threw in some code I found (https://p5js.org/examples/transform-scale.html) that was not made for a bouncing ball just to see what would happen. It turned out to look really nice so I kept it in and tweaked it some until I liked where it was.
