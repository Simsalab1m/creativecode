# Pop Punk Poem

This is a Python program that generates pop punk lyrics. It looks at a file called PopPunk.txt that is filled with lyrics from pop punk bands. It then uses those lyrics to createa new ones. It does this by categorizing all of the words based on their grammatical parts of speech tags. Then using that to create sentances based off of sentance structures from the lyrics being used. The more a word is used in all of the lyrics the more likely it is to get used in the generated lryics. 

I decided to do this becuase almost every knewer pop punk band sounds the same. The genre has always been formulaic, but it is worse now then it has ever been. I was curious how real my generated lyrics would look compared to real ones. I print out a real line from a song then a generated one to see how close they are and if they sound like they might be from the same song.
