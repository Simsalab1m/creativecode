Last time I heard about you.
You were smoking weed and taking off your clothes.
Thought I knew you.
Straight edge for life!

You shifted gears.
Blew like leaves in to the atmosphere.

The language of my love is wasted on your cold black heart.

I do not wan to waste my breath.
Even though you do not know yet.

I hate you, Lisa.
With those green eyes inside of your head.
And your white dress, such a mess.
Thrown at the side of my bed.

When your lips they whisper my name.
All your white lies make me cry.
God, you can drive me insane.

No way, no way!
Come back, come back, come back!
.

Ride It Out.

Break with you.
When we are close there is no way to lose.
Just a second, I can listen through.
Hear the truth.
Dance with you.
Change the rhythm in the way we move.
Just a second is enough to sweep.
You off your feet again.

Do not let this burn out.
Just leave your guard down.
Cause when I dream about you here I wan to ride it out (ride it out).
Know when you fall down.
I will have my arms out.
Cause when you are laying next to me I wan to ride it out (ride it out).

Breathe you in.
The nights we shared, I would like to live again.
Seemed like seconds that would never end.
Can we pretend?.stop the clock.
Draw our futures in the pavement chalk.
Stretch the moments when we lock our eyes.
And feel the light again.

Do not let this burn out.
Just leave your guard down.
Cause when I dream about you here I wan to ride it out (ride it out).
Know when you fall down.
I will have my arms out.
Cause when you are laying next to me I wan to ride it out (ride it out).

Do not worry, I am heading home.
If you will have me, you will not be alone.
Keep going, we will be alright.
Keep going, we will win the fight.
Do your best to hold on tight.

Wait for me.
I will be heading back to calmer seas.
Like a lullaby that you can feel.
Let is make it real again.

Do not let this burn out.
Just leave your guard down.
Cause when I dream about you here I wan to ride it out (ride it out).
Know when you fall down.
I will have my arms out.
Cause when you are laying next to me I wan to ride it out.
Ride it out! No!
Cause when you are.
laying next to me I wan to ride it out (ride it out).

.
Open Minded.

What you are missing out on is everything.
Without an open mind.
But if you just step out, hear the words to sing.
You will reach a whole new vibe.
If you would allow yourself to give in to change.
You would see that you could shine.
But if you keep yourself locked inside a cage.
You limit all your sight.

Let is be open minded.
Let is be undivided.
Let is be open minded.
And wide awake.

When you are flipping out over nothing.
It is just a waste of time.
What we choose is up to us we gotta see.
That we will be burning bright.
When will we find ourselves living this make believe.
In the lines of life.
Already off the shelf, now what is it going to be.
You are reaching for the light.

Let is be open minded.
Let is be undivided.
Let is be open minded.
And wide awake.

Let is be open minded.
Let is be undecided.
Let is be open minded.
And wide awake.

And still we are waiting, anticipating.
You point your finger out, the world will stop complaining.
Do not act so jaded, it is over-rated.
Yo this disaster can not be all that you have created.

You can not Blame Me.

I was so high last night.
Heard you talking but could not reply.
Something caught my eye.
Pulled me closer to the other side.

Is this what you wanted. to crash and to burn and. to learn it the hard way.
Congrats, yeah you earned it.

Wish I could get it right.
Nothing works, no matter what I try.

Sometimes.
The last thing I need is some sunlight.
But recently I am seeing this side.
Of 5 a.
m.way to o many nights.
You can not blame me.
I am not fine.
Pretending that everything is alright.
Cause this time just might be the last time.
That I will ever hear you say good night.
You can not blame me.

Now I am nothing but a voice inside your head.
Replaying all the memories we never had.
You can not take back all the words you never said.
Not everything made of gold is meant to last.

Is this what you wanted. to crash and to burn and. to learn it the hard way.
Congrats, yeah you earned it.

Now I am nothing but a ghost inside this bed.
An empty room that is filled with nothing but regret.

Sometimes.
The last thing I need is some sunlight.
But recently I am seeing this side.
Of 5 a.
m.way to o many nights.
You can not blame me.
I am not fine.
Pretending that everything is alright.

You can not blame me.

I am not fine.
Pretending it is alright, it is never been alright.
I am not fine.
Pretending it is alright, it is never been alright.

If I ever said I was fine I was lying (I am not fine). to keep you from finding the pills you are prescribing.
(Pretending it is alright, it is never been alright).
You are the one who always did the deciding (I am not fine).
So why are you crying when I am the one dying?.
(Pretending it is alright, it is never been alright).

Clockwork.
I am packing all my meds for the issues I have created.
I am ranting in my head because I am feeling kinda jaded.
The list goes on and on and on and on and on.

I am turning off my brain for the sake of feeling happy.
I am staring at the screen because I can not shake back my memory.
The list goes on and on and on and on and on.

Help me, I have been jumping headfirst in to fear like clockwork.
God, I hope this does not mean I am growing up now.
Help me, I have been jumping headfirst in to fear like clockwork.
God, I hope this does not mean I am growing up now.

Oh god, I lost my keys, do you remember where we went?.
I walked down like every street and I have not found them yet.
The list goes on and on and on and on and on.

Help me, I have been jumping headfirst in to fear like clockwork.
God, I hope this does not mean I am growing up now.
Help me, I have been jumping headfirst in to fear like clockwork.
God, I hope this does not mean I am growing up now.

None of this is going to last forever.
This is not the only path that I can take.
Now I know I am going to pull to gether.
Though I am running in the dark I am not afraid.

Till We are goinge.
Sinking low and feeling like I am out of time.
Now the clock is ticking on, least I am still alive.
I believe if we just keep going, soon enough life will fill with meaning.
Keep the search hot right until the end, the end, the end.

This year will fade in to a memory.
This life will live through all the centuries.
Time will change us, that will not faze our hearts.
This day will fade in to a memory.
Till we are goinge, goinge.
Till we are goinge, goinge.

Atmosphere is fading, a different kind of pain.
Seems like life is racing on, who will take my place?.
I believe if we do not stop reaching, soon enough we will find a reason. to keep the search hot right until the end, the end, the end.

This year will fade in to a memory.
This life will live through all the centuries.
Time will change us, that will not faze our hearts.
This day will fade in to a memory.
Till we are goinge, goinge.

If only I could rewind my timeline.
If only I could rewire my lost mind.
Every time I think about the places we went.
Yeah and every single person that we gave up and left.
 can not get back, can not get back.
 can not get back, can not get back.
What is goinge, goinge.
What is goinge.

This year will fade in to a memory.
This life will live through all the centuries.
Time will change us, that will not faze our hearts.
This day will fade in to a memory.

Where is My Charger.
Where is my charger.
I can not find my charger.
Got some girls, I gotta text, but my phone is on 1 percent.
So where is my fucking charger.
(Oh there it is).

.
Blast Off.
I can hear you now, it is the same old s to ry.
Cutting me down with your tales of glory.
I can not see the point, anyway.
You said to go to school, need to get a real job.
Marry a girl then you work work do not stop.
I can not see the point, anyway.

When you going to grow up, grow up.
Destiny is slipping away.
You gotta grow up, grow up.
You are all the same, you are just my enemy.

I am blasting off so say goodbye.
My final words are in the sky.
You take a look and see me flying, I am flying.
I am merely aiming for the stars.
It is just a path that is in my heart.
You gotta look to see me flying, I am flying.

I can hear you now testing all my patience.
Carrying on pointless conversations.
I refuse your points, anyway.
I got an attitude and I can not see reason.
So damn rude like I am the king of treason.
What backs up your points, anyway?.

When you going to grow up, grow up.
Destiny is slipping away.
You gotta grow up, grow up.
You are all the same, you are just my enemy.

I am blasting off so say goodbye.
My final words are in the sky.
You take a look and see me flying, I am flying.
I am merely aiming for the stars.
It is just a path that is in my heart.
You gotta look to see me flying, I am flying.

It is the life to be young. to be happy to see.
That the future is bright.
That was caught in between a moment, a moment, a moment.
I will be honest the good.
Always misunders to od.
Yeah the future is bright.
Even though it is a fight in this moment, this moment, this moment.

I am blasting off so say goodbye.
My final words are in the sky.
You take a look and see me flying, I am flying.
I am merely aiming for the stars.

Front Porch Step.
I Never Loved Before I Found You.

.
Burned.
Father I am sorry I have hurt you.
I am sorry I have stumbled like this.
This heart that still beats from the breath of your lips.
Is a heart that would kill you with a kiss.
And I know that you still choose to love me.
And it is something that I can not earn.
But I turned away and I ran to ward the flames.
What a wonderful way to get burned.

What a wonderful way to get burned.
You gave me it all, I threw it away.
I played with the fire.
What a wonderful way to get burned.

I faked love with a tall glass of water.
Was not long before she had her fill.because she had enough of the lack of our love.
And now she is going out for the kill.
And you to ld me you would love me forever.
But Jesus, will you ever learn.
That your place in my heart has been filled with such dark.
You will not see me when you have returned.

What a wonderful way to get burned.
You gave me it all, I threw it away.
I played with the fire.
What a wonderful way to get burned.
You gave me it all, I threw it away.
I played with the fire.
What a wonderful way.
What a wonderful way.
What a wonderful way.

You brought air to my lungs and then I turned my back.
You still loved me despite but I hated the fact.
That I hated myself more than I ever loved.
So the love that you had was just not good enough.
And I miss you so much that it burns in my chest.
Like the first cigarette that I smoked to impress.
If I had known then what I have done to you now.
I would pour gas on myself with it lit in my mouth.

What a wonderful way to get burned.
You gave me it all, I threw it away.
I played with the fire.
What a wonderful way to get burned.
You gave me it all, I threw it away.
I played with the fire.
What a wonderful way.
What a wonderful way.
What a wonderful way. to get burned.

.
Perfect Man.
Keep your lips away from me.

I do not want to feel your to uch.
because your heart is lacking truth,.
And your words do not come from love.

I would say mess with someone else,.
That is not something that you need.
because your soul is bent for hell,.
And your heart has been diseased.

.
I know that I am not perfect,.
But I am far from worthless.

You will need more than curves to make me care.

You are trying to control me.

Bringing up the old me.

Honey we both know that is not fair.

You just made a perfect man inside your mind.
And you got mad.
When I could not compare.

.
There is blood stains on my clothes,.
But it do not come from my wrist.

It just trickles down my nose,.
When I think about your kiss.

.
Baby, I know that I am not perfect,.
But I am far from worthless.

You will need more than curves to make me care.

You are trying to control me.

Bringing up the old me.

Honey we both know that is not fair.

You just made a perfect man inside your mind.
And you got mad.
When I could not compare.

.
We can never be to gether,.because you will never understand.
That I am not less human.because I am not a perfect man.

I am not a perfect man.

.
Baby, I know that I am not perfect,.
But I am far from worthless.

You will need more than curves to make me care.

You are trying to control me.

Bringing up the old me.

Honey we both know that is not.

Baby, I know that I am not perfect,.
But I am far from worthless.

You will need more than curves to make me care.

You are trying to control me.

Bringing up the old me.

Honey we both know that is not fair.

You just made a perfect man inside your mind.
And you got mad.
When I could not compare.

.
You just made a perfect man inside your mind.
You just made a perfect man inside your mind.

.
S to nes.
I know that I have made mistakes,.
And I am aware I have to ld some lies.

I am sorry that I broke your heart.

You will be glad to know that I broke mine.

Well I lost t willgood friends this year,.
And I buried both my dogs,.
So if you think that I have been hiding out of fear,.
Then you just do not know me at all.

You can hate me if you want to .

That is if you think you have got a right.

Just make sure that you are not jumping to conclusions.
Before you go to draw your knife.

.
I never meant to hurt a soul,.
But just keep saying what you will.

I just tried to use the earth to fill a hole,.
I have found that God can only fill.

I learned a lot of things this year.
But there is one thing that helped the most.

It is okay to burn a bridge down to the ground,.
Right where you should have built a moat.

.
I can feel the pressure coming over me like setting sails.

Tried to come to my senses,.
But sometimes they tend to fail.

And I tried to come out swinging.
But I could not hold back tears.

It is no wonder that a can of soup.
 can not get me through this year.

And I have taken advantage of the debt that Jesus paid.
And I am scared my heart has damage.
From the wars that I have waged.
And its true before, I have been a whore like Mary Magdalene,.
And I have felt s to nes that crack my bones,.
I am just glad that God stepped in.

I am glad that God stepped in.

.
Well, there is a Father that forgives,.
And there is a God that knows the truth.

So I am not scared to face his Judgment.

I am just scared that you will to o.

So you can go burn all my records,.
And put me six feet in the ground.

There is still a flame that burns forever in my heart.
Your hatred just can not put out.

.

Quick to Run.
I am not afraid of the dark anymore.
I am just afraid that I will not find the light.
I would kill myself if you promised me heaven.
Cause I am just to o tired to put up a fight.
I heard your words when I was just a boy.
So there is no excuse for the path that I chose.
When I am on my knees out in front of your gates.
Then I will not make excuses when that gate is closed.

I know I do not deserve you but I can not do this alone.
I am so sick of laying here on my own.

I wish you would carry me home.
Take me away from this house.
I hate to say this wretched man.
That you have made to look like you.
Do not look a damn thing like you now.
I used to smile so much.
But then I blocked out your son.
I am just another man that is broken his own heart.
It is no wonder that I am always quick to run.
I am always quick to run.

I am going to die in this ocean alone.
I lay on my back and I pray that I float.
I thought that I had the world on a string.
But now the whole world wants me hung from a rope.

I know I do not deserve you but I can not do this alone.
I am so sick of laying here on my own.

I wish you would carry me home.
Take me away from this house.
I hate to say this wretched man.
That you have made to look like you.
Do not look a damn thing like you now.
I used to smile so much.
But then I blocked out your son.
I am just another man that is broken his own heart.
It is no wonder that I am always quick to run.
I am always quick to run.

You pumped the blood in to my heart.
I poured out poison from my lips.
I am broken down in front of you.
I have come to break like porcelain.
I hate the bastard I became.
Far from the man that I have become.
You should have left me long ago.
I wish that I had never run.

I wish you would carry me home.
Take me away from this house.
I hope and pray that every day.
This wretched man that you have saved.
Could start to look like you somehow.

.
Truth.
You asked for lovin'.
And they gave you lines.
You hungered for some truth.
But they fed you lies.
You asked for shelter.
And they kept you trapped.
You beg them to hold you.
But they just hold you back.

Darlin' you know, it do not mean anything.
If you let his words be mistaken for proof.
I hope he protects you and makes you his everything.
When he tells you he loves you.
Just make sure he is telling the truth.

Your daddy left mama.
When you were just five.
So when he says forever.
You just want to hide.
Cause words do not mean nothing. to a heart that is been bruised.
He do not need to promise.
He just needs to prove.

Darlin' you know, it do not mean anything.
If you let his words be mistaken for proof.
I hope he protects you and makes you his everything.
When he tells you he loves you.
Just make sure he is telling the truth.

So when he holds you.
And he tells you he loves you.
Tell him that is something that he will have to prove.

Darlin' you know, it do not mean anything.
If you let his words be mistaken for proof.
I hope he protects you and makes you his everything.
When he tells you he loves you.
Just make sure he is telling the truth.

I Never Loved Before I Found You.
Who could love a man like me?.
Who would even want to share the air I breathe?.
I have been so wild like a dirty rotten dog,.
And they should shoot me for the blood drawn with my teeth.

.
I never loved before I found you.

As if you ever hid from me.

Love is not a word or a soft romantic verse,.
Or a soul that is trapped behind computer screens.

.
And they will all say I am not a Christian man.

They will claim I wrote this song to sell.

If they only knew.
About the things that I have goinge through.
They would not wish I would burn in hell.

.
Well I have fought to o many times.
But I do not think I have ever won.

Swung for the fences.

Was not raised to be defenseless.
But you learn that you just can not fight everyone.

I know they will always talk about me.
But you will not ever see me run.

They can black my eyes,.
They can shoot me with a gun.
But you will never kill the man that I have become.

.
And they will all say I am not a Christian man.

They will claim I wrote this song to sell.

If they only knew.
That is exactly what I used to do.
And why I still think I should burn in hell.

.
Who could love a man like me?.
The one that gives me air to breathe.

The same one that I have hung upon a cross.
Would get down on the ground and wash my feet for me.

.

Wrong Roads.
She left on Sunday.

No goodbye kiss.

You got the house.
But you lost where you live.

With just a box of wine.
And the old TV that do not work right.

You to ok your pills.
But you are still shaking inside.

.
Pick up the bottle and it will let you down.
Fill up your veins and you will still feel without.

Well you can find a woman and she will hold you tight.
Cause she do not know the demons that you hold inside.
The wrong roads seem easier when you have lost your mind.

.
You watch your favorite show,.
And think of her laugh.

You turn it off and hope.
The feeling will pass.

Catch your reflection,.
And you wish could not see it.
You smash the screen but.
You are the one that falls to pieces.

.
Pick up the bottle and it will let you down.
Fill up your veins and you will still feel without.

Well you can find a woman and she will hold you tight.
Cause she do not know the demons that you hold inside.
The wrong roads seem easier when you have lost your mind.

.
I know you are lonely son,.
But you are not the only one.

The wolves are vicious but.
They will kneel when he is done.

Put on your armor son.

The battle here has just begun.
But have faith and know that.
This war is already won.

.
Put down the bottle and reach for the light.

Wipe off the mud for you are no longer blind.

You know there is nothing you will ever find.
That could fill the void that he leaves inside.

Lay down your burdens son and open your eyes.

.
Put down the bottle and reach for the light.

Wipe off the mud for you are no longer blind.

You know there is nothing you will ever find.
That could fill the void that he leaves inside.

Lay down your burdens son and open your eyes.

.

Rewind.
Well this old train is broken down.

But I am glad it crumbled when it did.

It is kinda hard to stay on track.
Running through the darkness of your sin.

.
Someday you will wake up and find,.
You wish that you could rewind.
Take back mistakes that you made.
Mend all the hearts that you break.

Forgive but do not forget. to love those that want you dead.

Your biggest enemy resides inside your head.

.
The boys are going out to night.
They are probably looking for a fight.

The rest are searching for another broken heart.
Cause they are convinced that they will get them through the night.

.
Someday you will wake up and find,.
You wish that you could rewind.
Take back mistakes that you made.
Mend all the hearts that you break.

Forgive but do not forget. to love those that want you dead.

Your biggest enemy resides inside your head.

.
I just wanted to be famous.

I tried to make Ohio proud.

But I grew up worshiping Hank Williams.
And not the God he sang about.

.
Someday you will wake up and find,.
You wish that you could rewind.
Take back mistakes that you made.
Mend all the hearts that you break.

Forgive but do not forget. to love those that want you dead.

Your biggest enemy resides inside your head.

.

So Help Me God.
I feel this darkness creep like thunder.

It is rolling straight in to my spine.

I feel temptation pull me under.

My gold has lost all of its shine.

I try so hard to stay to gether.
When everything is falling apart.

I said that I would stay gold forever.

It seems that I have misplaced my heart.

Save me from myself.Hold me down.

Lock me away.Do not let me out.

Tie up my wrists and have me shot.

Please save yourselves.So help me God.

.
I once was pushed when I was younger.

I gashed my knee, and I loved the pain.
(Oh how I loved to feel the pain).
And suddenly I had the hunger. to rise up and make him feel the same.
(I think that is when I went insane).
I pushed him back but I pushed harder.
I watched him slam in to the ground.
(I watched him slam in to the ground).
One day I will die but I am no martyr.
And I fear that hell is where I am bound.

Save me from myself.Hold me down.

Lock me away.Do not let me out.

Tie up my wrists and have me shot.

Please save yourselves.So help me God.

So help me God.

.
This gunshot will drown out the noise in my head.
But these bloodstains will not cover the shame in my bed.
And I can not think about it cause I do not have the time.
Cause either way I will lose my mind.

.
Save me from myself.Hold me down.

Lock me away.Do not let me out.

Tie up my wrists and have me shot.

Please save yourselves.So help me God.

.
Save me from myself.Hold me down.

Lock me away.Do not let me out.

Tie up my wrists and have me shot.

Please save yourselves.So help me God.

.

Worship From A Wretch.
Teach me how to worship you for who you are.
Not for the feelings that I claim are in my heart.
No flashing lights.No attractive schemes.
Your beauty stretches out beyond my wildest dreams.

Teach me how to worship you with all my soul.
Not to impress in fear that I will look like a fool.
If I lift my hands, or if I am on my knees.
Help me make your praises be the only words I speak.

No repetitious lines that claim a love for the divine.
Then change my mind when I walk out the door.
Jesus, help me find the plank to pull out of my eye.
So I can do the work you built me for.

Jesus, help me worship you because you are.
Teach me discipline and let it steer my heart.
If someone next to me, can not even sing on key.
Let my heart be joyful that they are singing to my king.

Lord, I am a wretched man, that should take all the pain.
But you let them murder you so I would become a saint.
Forgive me for my trespasses, forgive me for my sins.
Teach me how to die each day so I can truly live.

No search for hope in vain in these self help books that can not help a thing.
Cause you are the only thing worth living for.
So break this wretch apart.Create in me a cleanly heart.
And kill the awful man I was before.

Teach me how to love a soul while hating sin.
And praise your name until my flesh is dust again.
Make me a faithful servant and a joyful slave.
Help me give my life to serve the one who is life you gave.


This is the age of descent
The fresh faced generation of defect
It is gotta come down before we reach for the reset
This is for the lost, downtrodden and rejects
And anybody looking for a purpose
We all kick our way through streets of grey
Some find hope in a TV screen
But nobody has an answer for anything
And no one can seem to agree

And then the 8 Ball said “things do not look great”
You know we can not break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we will see who is standing in the wasteland

It is just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
To tell the truth I never listen, just grit my teeth and split
It is just a matter of opinion when it comes down to it
But no one ever fucking listens
Yeah no one ever fucking listens
So you can take your damn opinion and fucking suck it

And then the 8 Ball said “things do not look great”
You know we can not break loose if we stay in place
Every earthquake starts with a little shake
And then we will see who is standing in the wasteland

I have had a steady stream of lonely nights
For the past few weeks in this room
I am locked away from it all
Just need a break from the walls that close me in
I will see this out standing on pins
I will fall asleep with my eyes open
Just to see if I could focus
On something more than my loneliness
None of my friends seem to give a shit about the way I am
I know full well they understand that
I get myself way too deep in what she said
But they will bail me out when I am in over my head

I am getting sick of being broke
But what is worse is I am all on my own
 can not seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I will see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell

Of all the things I hope to keep:
A childhood sense of opportunity
Grab life by the wrist and jump
Take the chance while I am still young and dumb

Passed out but on my feet
With years ahead to get some sleep
And so much time to face defeat
So write our names in wet concrete
To seal our place in space and time
Before we have to walk the line
Before we all move on in life
Before the sun comes up tonight

I am getting sick of being broke
But what is worse is I am all on my own
 can not seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep
Another day, another week in hell
I will see your face down here real soon
A welcome home to a swift farewell

I am getting sick of being broke
But what is worse is I am all on my own
 can not seem to let this go
I wish I could stop staring at the phone so I can get some sleep

A welcome home to a swift farewell

A swift farewell 


The golden groves are lined with affluence and roses,
But the bagheads down by Central Station are closer to where home is.
It can be grim and send you West from time to time,
Yeah, this place is such a shipwreck,
But this shipwreck, it is mine.

Day by day we grew to love this place,
And where I make my grave, my anchor lays.

I have been wasting away,
But in a town with no way out, there is not much else to do anyway,
If you are looking for a place to decay,
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry.

I have seen a punch or two,
Narrowly escaped a few,
And if you can get the day off, I could show you a view.
I remember the football games,
The first time that I got laid,
And the time J broke his finger drinking by the lake.

Day by day we grew to love this place,
And where I make my grave is where my anchor lays.
The sound of my youth echoes out through these empty streets,
I guess I can not kick up the roots;
It is home, and that is the truth.

I have been wasting away,
But in a town with no way out, there is not much else to do anyway,
If you are looking for a place to decay,
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry.

We know what it is like to be put down
So fuck you to the world, and stand your ground.
We know how to turn it inside out and get a little bit rowdy.

I have been wasting away,
But in a town with no way out, there is not much else to do anyway,
If you are looking for a place to decay,
Then there will always be a place in my town called revelry.

I am not stuck I am staying,
Yeah I said, I am not stuck I am staying.
And if you have got sorrows to drown and the bottom is where you are bound,
You will always have a place in my town called revelry. 


Sit still in the cold of February
Hold my hand in the cemetery, and you will be safe
I know that this is only temporary
And I do not think that it is helping anything

It is all fun and games until someone gets fucked up
This will end in tears, I could never be enough for you
Count my blessings on one hand and my curses on the other
Let you slip between my fingers, hide away until the summer

Kali Ma lean over me, rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to hell
You ignore my pleas
Indiana could not save me
So I guess I will save myself

We hopped from bench to bench, in the middle of our town
Where the streetlights hit your eyes, and then the tears came falling down
The love that you confessed, a product of your loneliness
I see right through you, but what do I do?

Of course I fall for it, just like I did when I was 16
Such a fool for you, did you ever even miss me?
Doubt it

Kali Ma lean over me, rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Then send me down to hell
You ignore my pleas
Indiana could not save me
So I guess I will save myself

Kali Ma lean over me
Rip your hand into my chest
Pull out my beating heart for the world to see
Oh wo not you go to hell? (Go to hell)

You are gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory
Maybe I, maybe I will
But not today 

I have been stuck in the middle pages,
Hung up on a cross that I created,
Built out of the bones that I have been breaking.
The sign you said you needed
Is there but you can not see it.
You might be down and out but you are still breathing.

If you write the story, then you will find out we are all stuck on the same page.

'Cause sometimes things will bend you,
But trust me you will be fine
'Cause I have been moving mountains that I once had to climb.
And life is not out to get you,
Despite the things you have been through,
Because what you give is what you get,
And it does not make sense to make do.

The walls are caving in again,
Happens every now and then,
Always got me feeling like I am fucked.
Falling in and out of bed,
Sleep so I feel like I am dead,
Trying to get a grip is kinda rough.

You say life has lost its meaning,
And that is true if you believe it,
But someday you will stand above your demons,
You are not beneath this.

If you write the story, then you will find out we are all stuck on the same page.

'Cause sometimes things will bend you,
But trust me you will be fine,
'Cause I have been moving mountains that I once had to climb.
And life is not out to get you,
Despite the things you have been through,
Because what you give is what you get,
And it does not make sense to make do.

So pick yourself up,
You can not change what is been,
You must go on and learn while you live.
And when you see the signs saying hope is up ahead,
Then you are right on track for a better end.

'Cause sometimes things will bend you,
But trust me you will be fine,
'Cause I have been moving mountains that I once had to climb.
And life is not out to get you,
Despite the things you have been through,
Because what you give is what you get,
Yeah, life is not out to get you
Yeah, life is not out to get you.


It is been a few days since I saw you last.
And there is a few things that I have to ask.
And so, the first is Do I hold you back? 
And did I fuck up too many times?
Found the bad I know you would find.

And just need some time and space.
We have fallen out of place,
But I pray to god we do not lose connection.

Just need to see you smile,
Or maybe stay a while
Before we lose all sense of direction.

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I am sorry for the things I do?
I am missing you like shit today.
And as the world spins on its axis,
Seems like it is brought me back here
To say Oh, God, not this again .

And I have not seen you smile this whole time.
It bums me out and makes me wonder why I can not do right.
And I am trying my best, I promise.
And I want this as long as you want it.

You asked me where we could meet.
I found you there at Lime Street.
One cig left in the packet.
Stood shy in your Dad is jacket.

A moment I will always keep.
Oh, take me back to Lime Street.
I swear to god you saved me.
I swear to god you saved me.

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I am sorry for the things I do?
I am missing you like shit today.
And as the world spins on its axis,
Seems like it is brought me back here
To say Oh, God, not this again .

Is it too late to say, too late to say
That I am sorry for the things I do?
I am missing you like shit today.
And as the world spins on its axis,
Seems like it is brought me back here
To say Oh, God, not this again .

Is it too late to say, too late to say?
Too late to say, too late to say?
Is it too late to say, too late to say?
I swear to god you save me
I swear to god you save me 


Do not get too close
That place is haunted
Fear not the ghosts
Cos she sent them running

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with the serpents
She strikes without a purpose

A dark face in a corridor
Deceptively beautiful
She is watching you
She is in everything you do
Her kiss it tastes so sweet
But left me with a lethargy
I could not shake, I made a grave mistake

I gave her my heart, she did not want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it
Since then I have not been the same
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it
Some men do not dare to speak her name

She picked me up from my decline
Healed my wounds with love and wine
Dosed me up and closed my eyes
A taste of poison
She gave me all that I desired
Sung the songs of angel choirs
Preached the words of death and fire and left me burning

I gave her my heart, she did not want it
Took it anyway and put a dark spell on it
Since then I have not been the same
Needed a victim and she got it
Took me in with her song, powerless to stop it
Some men do not dare to speak her name

She sleeps beneath the surface
Consorting with the serpents
She strikes without a purpose 


Sat on the stack
Held it all back
Let it all go to prevent a crack
And it seems I miss you dearly

Youth on my side
So I will find the time
I will grow up someday but for now I am fine
I just wish that you were near me

Glory days oh glory days behind me
Set deep in tainted skin
I am well aware so do not remind me
How I can not seem to win

Accept defeat
Curse the cracks of empty streets
And I do not wanna tell the same sad story
Even if I did, you would just ignore me

I wear myself out
Trying to find an ending
And I will work this out
When I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There is more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight is 20/20

My old man once said, Take heed, do not wait until you are just like me
To look back over history with nothing but regret. 

So all my friends sang fuck forever
Live today and die together
We do not wanna tell the same sad story
Heard it all before and that is fucking boring

I wear myself out
Trying to find an ending
And I will work this out
When I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There is more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight is 20/20

I wear myself out
Trying to find an ending
And I will work this out
When I stop pretending
That I could never let this go
There is more to life than chasing ghosts
But then hindsight is 20/20 


Stumbled around the block a thousand times
You missed every call that I had tried
So now I am giving up
A heartbreak in mid December
You do not give a fuck
You would never remember me
While you are pulling on his jeans
Getting lost in the big city
I was looking out our window
Watching all the cars go
Wondering if I will see Chicago
Or a sunset on the west coast
Or will I die in the cold
Feeling blue and alone
I wonder if you will ever hear this song on your stereo

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I am the last thing you would remember
It is been a long lonely December
I wish I would known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That is the last thing I remember
It is been a long lonely December

Cast me aside to show yourself in a better light
I came out grieving, barely breathing and you came out alright
But I am sure you will take his hand
I hope he is better than I ever could have been
My mistakes were not intentions this is a list of my confessions I could not say

Pain is never permanent but tonight it is killing me

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I am the last thing you would remember
It is been a long lonely December
I wish I would known that less is more
But I was passed out on the floor
That is the last thing I remember
It is been a long lonely December

I miss your face
You are in my head
There is so many things that I should have said
A year of suffering, a lesson learned [x2]

I hope you get your ball room floor
Your perfect house with rose red doors
I am the last thing you would remember
It is been a long lonely December
I wish I would known that less is more
(I miss you, I wish you well)
But I was passed out on the floor
(I miss you, and I wish you well)
That is the last thing I remember
(I miss you, I miss you)
It is been a long lonely December 


The leaves fell off as I did,
Guess it held some kind of meaning.
I have been lying in this bed of nails,
That let the wind out of my sails.

She left me on the bridge she is burning;
Hell, maybe I deserve it.
I am just trying to find my purpose,
I hope that it is all worth it.

And there will come a time,
When you will face your life,
Do not let it twist and tear you up inside

The world is a fucked up place,
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change,
You grow up and then you feel it.

Smooth seas do not make good sailors,
Jump ship and head for failure,
Find yourself a tragedy,
Slowly lose your sanity.

I will be alright, the
Bark was worse than your bite.
Left a scar that faded with time,
Echoed out to the back of my mind.

And there will come a time,
When you will face your life,
Do not let it twist and tear you up inside

The world is a fucked up place,
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change,
You grow up and then you feel it.

Smooth seas do not make good sailors,
Jump ship and head for failure,
Find yourself a tragedy,
Slowly lose your sanity.

And I have been walking round in circles,
Cursed every corner of this town,
Will I make it out?
And if I do then it is a godsend.
I caught a bullet in-between my teeth
Could this finally be the end?
I sat inside with a heavy heart
Just wish you would think of me
Are you listening?
Ran round in circles 'til after dark
Did not get very far
Was not meant to be
I never thought it would be this hard
It feels like you walked through me
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

Then maybe you would know just how it felt to be like me at my lowest
As you let me out the door, you tore me open
My final words were left unspoken

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you will see, then it is too little too late
I was not good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you
I hope this comes back to haunt you

Told myself that this would be the last time you kept me awake
Some day you will see, then you will be stuck in this place
I was not good enough for you, and then you just stopped trying
What can I say?

And everyday that is passing is surely mine to seize
Did every wave that crashed in leave you washed up at her feet?

Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you have been left bruised and broken
Say I will be ok, I will be ok 
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you have been left bruised and broken
Say I will be ok, I will be ok 
Wake up, the world seems bright out today
Life goes on, and things they change
Hands up if you have been left bruised and broken
Say I will be ok, I will be ok 


Dancing on the grave you made to hide me,
Remove the pictures from the walls
'Cos they are reminding you of all the things you try so hard to hide.
And she digs the grave, so she knows just where she can find it.

And I do not have much to offer,
But had you loved me I would have loved you back forever.

Here I am again, rock bottom.
Dug this hole to hell to rot in.
Should not have ignored my friends,
It frayed the rope that they had dropped in.
Here I lay again, rock bottom.
What was life like?
I have forgotten how the sun felt on my skin,
Resurrect and start again.

She said, You are distant from the world and self-destructive, 
But she still smiles and laughs along for self-indulgence.
She is got her finger on the pulse and she feels nothing,
She digs the grave so she can dance like no one is watching.
And I know you are chasing something,
Or has what you wanted got you scared and running?
And I know you are missing something,
Because I felt it there that night, and caught you blushing

Here I am again, rock bottom.
Dug this hole to hell to rot in.
Should not have ignored my friends,
It frayed the rope that they had dropped in.
Here I lay again, rock bottom.
What was life like?
I have forgotten how the sun felt on my skin,
Resurrect and start again.

The ebb and flow of life is mystery,
So I guess I will never know.
Yeah, I got caught up in history,
So I think it is time for me to let this go. [2x]

Here I am again, rock bottom.
Dug this hole to hell to rot in.
Should not have ignored my friends,
It frayed the rope that they dropped in.
Here I lay again, rock bottom.
What was life like?
I have forgotten how the sun felt on my skin,
Resurrect and start again.

Break out, I need to break out, I need to break out,
Gotta get me out or I am gonna break down,
I am gonna break down,
I have hit rock bottom.
Resurrect and start again. [2x] am'

There will come a time,
When you will face your life,
Do not let it twist and tear you up inside

The world is a fucked up place
But it depends on how you see it
Life is full of change
You grow up and then you feel it.

Smooth seas do not make good sailors,
Jump ship and head for failure,
Find yourself a tragedy,
Slowly lose your sanity.

Find yourself a tragedy,
Slowly lose your sanity. 


Life is one fucking beauty contest after another. School, then college, then work Fuck that. And fuck the Air Force Academy. If I want to fly, I will find a way to fly. You do what you love, and fuck the rest

Ever since I was a kid
I knew that I was different
From the rest with shaking hands
And a chemically unbalanced head
I scared the shit out of everyone
With everything I said
I always had the hardest time
Making new friends and
I still get those headaches
I did when I was young
I still forget to watch the words
That fall off my tongue

This is a soundtrack
To a movie
A motion picture
That will always move me
A painted portrait
Of candid moments
My heart’s the canvas
And I’m the illustrator

A suburban family home
A bedroom of my own
A collection of cds
Stacked up next to
A blown out stereo
Were the only things
That keep me from
Feeling alone like I had
Someone to talk to
It’s hard enough when
No one seems to get you

Most days I feel fine
And others I feel like
I’m dying on the inside
Forcing smiles on the outside
I’m an optimist and
A pessimist in one

This is a soundtrack
To a movie
A motion picture
That will always move me
A painted portrait
Of candid moments
My heart’s the canvas
And I’m the illustrator

And if I were to suddenly die
I’d take a good look back
At my whole life
Be proud of the things
That I said and I did
I know I wasn’t innocent
But I’ve always listened
To the pound of the kick
And the strum of the pick
Telling me that this is it

I’m an optimist and
A pessimist in one

This is a soundtrack
To a movie
A motion picture
That will always move me
A painted portrait
Of candid moments
My heart’s the canvas
And I’m the illustrator
I couldn’t paint you
A better picture 


It brings out the worst in me
Plagues me just like a disease
A dark cloud that wo not seem to let me be
Ruining everything

Miserable at my very best
A walking cliche like the rest
Wish they could find a way to fix my head
And feel like myself again

It is just like me to give into my grief
Should not be surprised that, that I feel so alone

Anxiety is got a hold on me
It is got me by the neck and wo not let me breathe
It cuts right down to the bone, yeah
I 'am' living proof of a tortured soul

Fell asleep on the couch again
It is been three months since I have seen my friends
Alienated is what I tend to do best
When I am down and I am out again

I guess it is true that I cut my own rope
Should not be surprised that, that I feel so alone

Anxiety is got a hold on me
It is got me by the neck and wo not let me breathe
It cuts right down to the bone, yeah
I am living proof of a tortured soul
There is no solution to my seclusion
I guess it is best I stay tied to this bed
Anxiety is got a hold on me
It is got me by the neck and wo not let me breathe

If you could see in my head
You would understand why I can not control a shaking hand
Day in, day out, captive to my doubts
Thoughts never match the words from my mouth
When I wake up tomorrow and feel the same
Not a thing I can do to numb the pain
It is pulling me under, blood is in the water
Can I make it out alive?

It brings out the worst in
Plagues me just like a disease
A dark cloud that wo not seem to let me be
Ruining everything

Anxiety is got a hold on me
It is got me by the neck and wo not let me breathe
It cuts right down to the bone, yeah
I am living proof of a tortured soul
There is a solution to my seclusion
I guess it is best I stay tied to this bed
Anxiety is got a hold on me
It is got me by the neck and wo not let me breathe 




Go

Wide awake on a cold hard floor
How much longer can I take this for
God only knows it I will make it through the year
But I am not sure if he exists, so
The answer to this remains unclear
Hard to believe when my demons reappear

Woah, yeah

Another night of an endless fight
Fixing to find some kind of peace of mind
Flew out the door with my light hearted state of mind

So long, I am gone
I can not live like this anymore
Goodbye, red eyes, I will be sleeping rest assure

Stuck at a fork in the road
A little unsure about where to go
The path I choose I know will guide me home
I can feel it
I am better off than I was before
You could not stand to see me face down on the floor
There is a little bright light at the end of the road
And a sign that says Hey kid, welcome home 

Woah, yeah

Safe to say I am at my lowest point
This has been the roughest year of my whole life
And it is not even summer yet
How can I find hope when it always waits
Inside of my head, day after day
I know you are wrong yeah, something is gotta change

Wasted anger on these walls too many times
I think it is time I open my red eyes
Realize that I am just wasting time

Stuck down a fork in the road
A little unsure about where to go
The path I choose I know will guide me home
I can feel it
I am better off than I was before
You could not stand to see me face down on the floor
There is a little bright light at the end of the road
And a sign that says Hey kid, welcome home 

Woah
Hey kid, welcome home
Yeah 




Winter is over but I feel colder

I caught a glimpse of my reflection today
Could not help but notice how much I have changed
And then I thought back to those calm carefree days
When there was nothing in my way

But hey, I know you hate me for going crazy
I have not been myself, pessimism does not help
And hey, yeah it is pathetic, I am apathetic
I do this to myself, it is my own living hell

Expect the worst when I am around
Your head is in the clouds but I will bring you down
I am jaded, frustrated, and burnt out
So expect the worst cause I will be sure to let you down

Sitting on this lookout all alone
Thinking I may never come back home
Running from my problems, the only way to solve them
But I still do not know where I am running too

But hey, please do not hate me for going crazy
I know my point of view is a little more than skewed

Expect the worst when I am around
Your heads in the clouds but I will bring you down
I am jaded, frustrated, and burnt out
So expect the worst cause I will be sure to let you down

Winter is over but I feel colder
The chip on my shoulder is taking over
Blocking out the lights
Standing on the edge of the tallest building
Surely it is a trap but clear we are falling
I will find the answers down below
And figure out why I became an asshole

Expect the worst when I am around
Your heads in the clouds but I will bring you down
I am jaded, frustrated, and burnt out
So expect the worst cause I will be sure to let you down

Expect the worst when I am around
Your heads in the clouds but I will bring you down
I am jaded, frustrated, and burnt out
So expect the worst cause I will be sure to let you down

I will let you down 




Bury me alive
Six feet under lies
Pile up the dirt
And then just leave me here to die

All the sacrifices that I have made
Calls for an open grave
Like a conscious autopsy
Find your knife pierce through me
Wide awake as you cut me apart
If light comes from within
Well then yours must be dimmed

You are the death of me
And I am not scared to go to hell
Cause I know you will be there as well

Bury me alive
Six feet under lies
Pile up the dirt
And then just leave me here to die
If I had just one wish
I would drag you down with me
Rot hand in hand for eternity

When I said I would die for you
I meant the honest truth
I always keep my promises
And now I will follow through
Digging your ditch tonight
I will enjoy the view of worms by the glow of candle light

I dare you to join me
And I am not scared to go to hell
Cause I know you will be there as well

Bury me alive
Six feet under lies
Pile up the dirt
And then just leave me here to die
If I had just one wish
I would drag you down with me
Rot hand in hand for eternity

As I take my final breath
And start to close my eyes
I am thankful for this time I get to have you by my side
So lay your head upon my chest
As our love decays
Underneath the solid ground
Where we will spend all our days
Down here, down here

Bury me alive
Six feet under lies
Pile up the dirt
And then just leave me here to die
If I had just one wish
I would drag you down with me
Rot hand in hand for eternity

Just bury me


Hey Smokie, you going to the show tonight?
Nah man, I do not think so. I did not get a ticket and I think it is sold out
Why would you sleep on the ticket? They just put out the best 7 inch
I do not know man, I think I like the last record better. Way more feeling. How are you getting in?
Dude, I am best friends with the band

I do not wanna talk about all your favorite records
And I do not really care what bands you think are better
Just another hypocrite in a room that is filled with idiots
You and I both know it
(Fuck)

How can you expect to grow
When vanity is all that you know
Save your breath and swallow your pride
You wo not go far with that state of mind
(Go)

(Woah, woah)
Yeah you got in on the guest list
(Woah, woah)
You know you could not resist it
(Woah, woah)
The idea, another empty friendship
And I hope it is worth it 



Woah, sorry
Woah, hahaha
Woah

Woah-woah
Woah-woah
Woah-woaaah
Woah-woah
Woah-woah
Woah-woaaah

Just like a wrecking ball swinging through a second story window
Everything is in pieces, my eyes just can not believe that
I feel the undertow pulling hard, never letting go
I can not fight this sinking feeling, hate the hands that they have been dealing

Instill the image of a saint
Into the heads of the people you hate

Lost my way and all my faith
The only thing that I believed in
Turned out to be something so different
And all I have left in me
Is some paper and a microphone
A sore throat and a broken home

Woah-woah
Woah-woah
Woah-woaaah
Woah-woah
Woah-woah
Woah-woaaah

On the opposing team, out for blood, not playing clean
Racking up the penalties. I do not watch my mouth I, say what I mean
Been doing this since nineteen what makes you think that you know anything, yeah
It is you who fuels the anger for these words I put on paper

Thick skin but I can see through you
Vomit lies while you choke on the truth

Lost my way and all my faith
The only thing that I believed in
Turned out to be something so different
And all I have left in me
Is some paper and a microphone
A sore throat and a broken home

I wo not forget that first December
I felt alive for the first time ever
Disappointment swallowed me
And sent me right back on the street

I lost my way and all my faith
The only thing that I believed in
Turned out to be something so different
And all I have left in me
Is some paper and a microphone
A sore throat and a broken home

The reason for my disenchantment
I know you will take this for granted
Bled me dry of all my passion
This did not go the way I planned it
The reason for my disenchantment
I know you will take this for granted
Bled me dry of all my passion
This did not go the way I planned it 


I saw a ghost of myself down by the river
We always used to throw rocks in
I could not help but sit there, stare up and wonder
Just where the hell that person is been

Remember those nights never seem to end
Well they did and we will never get 'em back again

I do not, I do not, feel the same way as I used to
But I guess, I guess, that is what happens
When you let nostalgia get the best of you, you

Bonfires lit up the dead of the winter
It is so good to be home again
Watch the sunset with all our friends
We drank away the weekends
We were so naive back then

There is not one thing that I would change, I would live it just the same
And I would make all the same mistakes

I do not, I do not, feel the same way as I used to
But I guess, I guess, that is what happens
When you let nostalgia get the best of

Wish I had all the time in the world
To count the stars in the sky, or just waste time
By counting cars passing by
Staring at clouds while questioning life

When I die, bury me by the river
We always used to throw rocks in

I do not, I do not, feel the same way as I used to
But I guess, I guess, that is what happens
When you let nostalgia get the best of you

I packed my bags, you cried your eyes
It does not get much easier to say goodbye
I never called to get this right
Always the same thing every time

So here is a song for all of the times
I never called much, you were on my mind

I hope you know (I hope you know)
When I am out on the open road
I count the days til I get home so we could be alone
I have seen the mountains, lakes, the tall palm trees
But they do not compare with what you mean to me

You dropped me off for the door
Tell her I can not do this anymore
I kiss your head, I am out the door
I promise I am worth waiting for

I wo not forget to charge my phone this time
As long as you stay on the other line

I hope you know (I hope you know)
When I am out on the open road
I count the days til I get home so we could be alone
I have seen the mountains, lakes, the tall palm trees
But they do not compare with what you mean to me

I know it feels like I am a ghost when
You are in the bedroom all alone and
You have got our picture on the night stand
Fell asleep with the TV on again

So play this song at night when
You are feeling left behind
And if you swear to hold on tight then
I will be right by your side

I hope you know (I hope you know)
When I am out on the open road
I count the days til I get home so we could be alone
I have seen the mountains, lakes, the tall palm trees
But they do not compare with what you mean to me
I count the days til I get home so we could be alone


Finally the sun is shining
So bright it is almost blinding
Hope you know that I am doing fine
I am no longer losing my mind
This past year just got so crazy
My focus got a little hazy
Feeling alright for the
First time in the longest time

Oh it is not that fun
Hiding from everyone

What else could I do
I had everything to lose
Do not let the weight just bury you
I am the one to blame
For why I felt that way
Standing in the pouring rain

Friends scattered across the country
Let me know I am in good company
From the south to the Golden State
And everywhere in between

And oh I should have known
That I was never alone

What else could I do
I had everything to lose
Do not let the weight just bury you
I am the one to blame
For why I felt that way
Standing in the pouring rain

Woah, woah
Woah, woah

They say, my whole life is like
Staring down the barrel of a loaded gun
But I wo not turn around and run
No I wo not, no I wo not
They say, my whole life is like
Staring down the barrel of a loaded gun
But I wo not turn around and run

What else could I do
I had everything to lose
Do not let the weight just bury you
I am the one to blame
For why I felt that way
Standing in the pouring rain

What else could I do
I had everything to lose
Do not let the weight just bury you
I am the one to blame
For why I felt that way
Standing in the pouring rain

I am the one to blame
