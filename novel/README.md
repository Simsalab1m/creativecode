# My Novel

Going into this project I was trying to think of 2 or more things that would create a funny outcome. I started with every script of the Fast and Furious franchise and was suprised with how funny the outcome was just off of that. After that I spent some time thinking about what would be fun to add to it. I asked some friends what they thought would be a good addition one of them told me Lord of the Rings. So I added all the scripts from the Lord of the Rings movies and the Hobbit movies.
